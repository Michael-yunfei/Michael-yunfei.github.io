			<p>
				In my first  post (<a href="../Nov2020/EnglishPronunciation1.html">link</a>) about pronunciation, I wrote <q>vowels are the soul of English words</q>. In this post, I would continue to do discourse on this principle by explaining how we could use vowels to spell a word.

				Suppose you know the pronunciation of a word, when you try to spell it out, you should follow this rule: letters for consonants and vowels should be intwined in each other.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's use some examples to explain the above rule (by the way, if you have already known this, please don't laugh at me as I found it very late.). I just selected 10 random words and made the following figure. Hope you would understand what I am trying to explain here.
				<center>
					<img src="../images/vowelStructure.png" width="86%"/>
				</center>

				The pattern is that all consonants are companied by vowels. A mix of consonants and vowels in each English word makes up one unit of pronunciation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Take the word 'badminton' as an example. It is pronunciated as /&#98;&#230;&#100;&#109;&#618;&#110;&#116;&#601;&#110;/, in which each unit of sound is `brought out` by a vowel sound. Once you know the sound of badminton, then you could spell it easily with the following sequence: bad - min (like mint) - ton, where again each unit has a vowel.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's examine another example - plagiarism. Every time when I spell this word, very often I would spell it as `plagrism`, <b>which is wrong</b>.
				<ul>
					<li>
						when you spell it as `plagrism` it should be pronunciated as plag-rism (/&#112;&#108;&#101;&#618;&#103;&#114;&#618;&#122;&#601;&#109;/), where `plag` has the same sound like plague (`ue` is silent, `g` is pornunciated like it does in the word `leg`).
					</li>
					<li>
						The correct way to spell is `plagiarims`, which has the pronunciation /&#112;&#108;&#101;&#618;&#676;&#601;&#114;&#618;&#122;&#601;&#109;/.
					</li>
				</ul>
				The following figure gives the further explanation.

				</center>
			</p>

			<h5>Tips Are Not Rules</h5>
			<p>
				The spelling structure based on vowel sounds should only serve you as tips not rules as language is a living being and it exists dynamically. No certain patterns could apply to all words. For instance, you might have been confused by spellings of <i>explain</i> and its noun <i>explanation</i>. The first one is spelled with `plain`, the second is spelled with `plana` (without `i`). If you want to know why, you could read this post (<a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/why-doesn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%9Cexplanation%E2%80%9D-have-%E2%80%9Ci%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%9Cexplain%E2%80%9D#:~:text=The%20spelling%20of%20explane%20morphed,t%20undergo%20the%20same%20transformation.&text=The%20Online%20Etymology%20Dictionary%20says,the%20influence%20of%20troublesome%20friends.">Link</a>). By the way, I highly recommend this podcast: <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl">Grammar Girl</a> by <i>Mignon Fogarty</i>.

					During the preparation of this post, I made use of the follwing video (the woman in the video is funny).
				</p>

			</div>

			<h5>Last Example on Wednesday</h5>

			<p>
				It is Wednesday when I am writing this post, and the word `Wednesday` actually does not have the pattern we have discussed as it has the structure `Wednes·day`, where `wednes` part has one vowel sound but two vowels (two e). Because its structure is not common, it is actually one of the hardest word to spell as people very often would spell it in this way: `Wednsday`. Do you know why people tend to make this kind of mistake?
