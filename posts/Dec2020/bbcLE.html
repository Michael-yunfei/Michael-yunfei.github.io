			<h4>Why time matters?</h4>

			<p>
				When we learn something, time matters as skills and understanding could only accumulate time after time. If you were trying to learn a language within several weeks, you would not get too much of it. Language in general is probably one of the most complex systems human being has ever created. With so many vocabularies, grammar rules, and phrases, it naturally takes ages for anyone to become a fluent speaker and writer.
			</p>

			<p>
				After spending many years on learning English, I enter into a stage where I feel I am stuck. On one hand, I could understand most time when I am watching live news, such as BBC News or PBS Hours. On the other hand, when I try to express myself either through speaking or writing, I am not very confident about my usage of words and grammar. So, to improve my English in a systematic way, I decided to take a course developed by BBC (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/">Link</a>). On the website, you could find many courses, ranging from lower-intermeidate to advanced courses. Right now, I am following the lower-intermediate one even though it is easy to me as I want to train myself once again.
			</p>

			<p>
				I like the course as each one has 30 units, and it teaches you new vocabularies, grammar and trains your listening and speaking with multimedias. So, if you want to improve your English too, it's better to go through all units with instructions and practicing of activities. Again, time matters when it comes to serious learning. Actually, times matter for almost anything. Only throught time, we know who we are and we become who we are.
			</p>

			<h4>Unit 1: Nice to meet you!</h4>

			<p>
				First, listen to this podcast and learn some vocabularies.
			</p>
			<center>
					<audio
	        controls
	        src="../audios/u1_6min_vocab.mp3">
	            Your browser does not support the
	            <code>audio</code> element.
						</audio>
			</center>

			<p>
				Second, listen to this podcast and learn the grammar.
			</p>
			<center>
					<audio
	        controls
	        src="../audios/u1_6min_gram.mp3">
	            Your browser does not support the
	            <code>audio</code> element.
						</audio>
			</center>

			<p>
				Third, listen to this conservation from an interview and use it to prepare for your interview.
			</p>
			<center>
					<audio
	        controls
	        src="../audios/u1_s3_a1_keith_interview.mp3">
	            Your browser does not support the
	            <code>audio</code> element.
						</audio>
			</center>

			<h4>What I learned from this unit</h4>

			<p>
				Overall, this unit is quite easy to me. However, I still learned something, especially from the interview podcast. Okay, look at the following pictures, could you form a question properly?
			</p>
			<center>
				<img src="../images/eng_u1_q1.png", width="60%" />
				<img src="../images/eng_u1_q2.png", width="60%" />
			</center>

			<br />

			<p>
				When I was doing these two questions, I got them wrong. The right way to ask is:
				<ul>
					<li>
						What's the most interesting place you have ever visited? (I did in this way: what's the most interesting place have you ever visited?)
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the normal day for you at work? (my answer is: what is the normak work day for you?)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				I didn't learn many new vocabularies from this unit, but three words are worth mentioning:

				<ul>
					<li>
						worth (adjective):
						<ul>
							<li>
								equivalent in value to the sum or item specified: jewelry worth $450 was taken.
							</li>
							<li>
								sufficiently good, important, or interesting to justify a specified action; deserving to be treated or regarded in the way specified: the museums in the district are well worth a visit.
							</li>
							<li>
								used to suggest that the specified course of action may be advisable: a meat and potato dish that's worth checking out.
							</li>
							<li>
								used to present a comment, suggestion, or opinion without making a claim as to its importance or validity: for what it's worth, she's very highly thought of abroad.
							</li>
							<li>
								<i>informal</i> sufficiently good, enjoyable, or successful to repay any effort, trouble, or expense: it requires a bit of patience to learn, but it's well worth it.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						fed up (adjective):
						<ul>
							<li>
								annoyed or upset at a situation or treatment: he was fed up with doing all the work.
							</li>
							<li>
								<i>British</i> extremely annoyed or unhappy: I'm fed up to the back teeth with the mess he's landed us in.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						intimate (adjective), imitate (verb) and intimidate (verb):
						<ul>
							<li>
								intimidate: frighten or overawe (someone), especially in order to make them do what one wants: he tries to intimidate his rivals.
							</li>
							<li>
								imitate: take or follow as a model: his style was imitated by many other writers.
							</li>
							<li>
								intimate: closely acquainted; familiar, close: intimate friends | they are on intimate terms.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>News Report</h4>

			<p>
				In each unit, BBC Learing English would put an podcast from news for students to practice listening and learn more vocabularies. Here you go:
			</p>
			<center>
					<audio
	        controls
	        src="../audios/u1_s4_news_report_tipping.mp3">
	            Your browser does not support the
	            <code>audio</code> element.
						</audio>
			</center>

			<p>
				Okay, which country is the most tip friendly on earth? (You see, I made a mistake again.) The right way to ask this kind of question should be:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Which is the most tip friendly country on earth ?
					</li>
					<li>
						Which country has the tallest mountain in the world?
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the best family board game to play at Christmas?
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				This is the end of unit 1. There is so much to learn but so less time to spare. See you next time :)
			</p>
