			Last year, I created my first website by using Hugo. When I finished the deployment and visited it, I was very excited as I could use my website to do so many things, such as presenting my project, uploading my notes of different subjects, of course, writing blogs. I created my first blog on Aug 4, 2019. Later. Unlike most people who create their websites and leave it alone very soon after typing some blogs, I was actually maintaining my website by writing more blogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			 However, when I was trying to add more content or different functions, I realized that my website built upon the technology provided by Hugo was not enough. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Its official website claims that it is the world's fastest framework for building websites. After spending around 30 hours learning it, I could build my website and create my first blog there. Therefore, I would give the credit for its speed and flexibility. But, it is not flexible enough especially when you want to expand the functions of your website. It is very often that you would fail to deploy your website if you could not create the content based on formats provided by Hugo.
		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, I decided to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by myself for giving myself complete control of my website ranging from content, design to interactive functions. By the time I am writing this blog, I am able to use HTML and CSS to design a static website I visioned. I am quite happy with my progress.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the future, I hope I could use my website as a tool for organizing my life. Every day, we browse so many things throught the internet. Among all the information I search or process, some of them are valuable, some of them are just wasting of time. This website would serve as a filter that will save more useful and organized information. At the end of each year or each stage of my career, I could just visit my website to check what I have done. Furthermore, we need to keep learning in this digital era, in which our brain needs process information constantly. Unless you really have a very good memory, otherwise it is better to let computer store information for us.

			I am listening to the classical music from French composers when I am writing this blog. Hope, you would enjoy it too.
