            <h4>Unit 8: Articles: a, an, the</h4>

            <p>
                English has two articles: then and a/an. The is used to refer to
                or specific or particular nouns; a/an is used to modify non-specific 
                or non-particular nouns. Beginners know we should use a before 
                a consonant sound and an before a vowel sound. This is fairly easy. 
                But when it comes to the usage of definite article 'the', people 
                might get confused. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Okay, here are rules for using 'the'. We use the definite article 
                in front of a noun when we believe the listener/reader knows 
                exactly what we are referring to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        because there is only one:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The Pope is visiting Russia.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The moon is very bright tonight (or she is the one).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is why we use the definite article with a 
                                superlative adjective: She is the best. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        because there is only one in that context:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We live in a small house next to the church. 
                        (= the church in our village)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        because we have already mentioned it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A young man got a nasty shock when he tried to rob 
                        a jewellery shop in Richmond. The man used a 
                        heavy hammer to smash the windows in the shop.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also use the definite article to say something about 
                        all the things referred to by a noun:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The wolf is not really a dangerous animal. 
                                (= Wolves are not really dangerous animals.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The kangaroo is found only in Australia. 
                                (= Kangaroos are found only in Australia.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The heart pumps blood around the body. 
                                (= Hearts pump blood around bodies.)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We use the definite article in this way to talk about 
                        musical instruments:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Joe plays the piano really well.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                She is learning the guitar.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to refer to a system or service:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                How long does it take on the train?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I heard it on the radio. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You should tell the police. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can also use the definite article with adjectives like 
                        rich, poor, elderly and unemployed to talk about groups 
                        of people: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Life can be very hard for the poor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I think the rich should pay for more taxes. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                She works for a group to help the disabled.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not normally use the definite article with names:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        William Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Paris is the capital of France.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Iran is in Asia.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But, we do use the definite article with:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        countries whose names include words like kingdom, 
                        states or republic:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The United Kindom</li>
                            <li>The United States</li>
                            <li>the People's Republic of China</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        countries which have plural nouns as their names:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the Netherlands</li>
                            <li>the Philippines</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        geographical features, such as mountain ranges, 
                        groups of islands, rivers, seas, oceans and canals:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the Atlantic</li>
                            <li>the Amazon</li>
                            <li>I live in the north-west of Egypt, in the east</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        newspapers, organizations, well-know buildings, hotels,
                        pubs, and families: the Times, the United Nations. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parts of the day: in the morning/afternoon/evening
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most prepositional phrases of position and place: at the top, 
                        on the left, at the office/bank/cinema
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Take note: school/university, etc.</b>
                <br>
                There is a special rule for these places: school, university, 
                college, hospital, prison, church. Compare these examples:
                <table>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td >The children go to school by bus.  </td>
                        <td >I go to the school to help twice a week.</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td >Ben's studying maths at university.</td>
                        <td >  He works in the canteen at the university.</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td >She was in hospital for three weeks.</td>
                        <td >Is there a shop in the hospital? </td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                    </table>
                    If someone is at the place because they are a student 
                    / are sick / a prisoner, etc, we don't use the. 
                    If they are there for another reason, or we are talking 
                    about the building, we use the.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adjectives go between articles and nouns: What a great place this is! 
                I went on an amazing trip. We went to the famous Bondi beach.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Pronouncing articles:</b> this is quite important. I didn't 
                know this before I learned it from the BBC Learning English website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We usually pronounce a/an with a weak vowel sound /ə/ ('uh'). 
                It sounds like the vowel sound in fun, and not the vowel sound in cat.
                Before consonants and the letters u or eu when they are pronounced y (/j/), 
                we pronounce the with this weak sound /ə/, too: the doctor, the party, 
                the uniform. But when the is before a vowel sound, we pronounce the with the 
                long ee sound in see: 
                the afternoon, the ice, the open door, the upstairs rooms

                could have compound adjectives with numbers: a 22-hour journey, 
                a four-kilometer course. We also have compound adjectives with
                high and low: a low-cost airline, a low-fat yoghurt. <i>
                You need a hyphen to construct a compound adjective.
