            <h4>Unit 11 and 12: Present Perfect</h4>
            
            <p>
                Present perfect tense refers to an action or state that either 
                occurred at an indefinite time in the past (e.g., we have talked before)
                or began in the past and continued to the present time (e.g., He has 
                grown impatient over the last hour). This tense is formed by: 
                <b>have/has + the past participle</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The important thing to remember about the present perfect is that 
                you cannot use it when you are being specific about when it happened:
                <ul>
                    <li>Correct: I have put away all the laundary.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: I have put away all the laundary this morning.</li>
                </ul>
                You can use the present perfect to talk about the duration of something that
                started in the past and is still happening:
                <ul>
                    <li>Correct: she has had the chickenbox since Tuesday.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Take note:</b> we still use the past participle when we are talking
                about the negative present perfect situation or ask questions in the tense
                of present perfect. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Negative present perfect: have/has not + the past participle 
                        (I have not had a chance to vist Paris until now.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Past simple: did you visit paris last year?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever worked in China?</li>
                    <li>Have you known Sara for a long time (or since last year)?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Take note:</b> we cannot use present simple or present continuous 
                with <b>for</b> and <b>since</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorrect: I know him for ten years.</li>
                    <li>Correct: I have known him for ten years.</li>
                    <li>Wrong: I am living here since 2002.</li>
                    <li>Correct: I have lived there since 2002.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Take note:</b> we could also use the present prefect continuous 
                tense (also known as the present perfect progressive tense) to show that 
                something started in the past and is still happening (or is continuing)
                at the present time. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: I have been reading War and Peace for a month now.</li>
                </ul>
                In this sentence, using the present perfect continuous verb tense conveys 
                that reading War and Peace is an activity that began sometime in 
                the past and is not yet finished in the present 
                (which is understandable in this case, given the length of Tolstoy’s weighty tome).
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, not all verbs are compatible with continuous actions. 
                Some examples of such verbs are to be, to arrive, and to own. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorrect: I have been owning my Iphone since 2007.</li>
                    <li>Correct: I have owned my Iphone since 2007.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: I have been living in this hourse since 2002.</li>
                    <li>Correct: I have lived in this house since 2002.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Take note:</b> With verbs like work and live, which can describe 
                permanent or temporary situations, we usually use the present perfect + 
                ‘for’ / ‘since’ for a long period of time. For a short period, 
                we use the present perfect continuous.
                <ul>
                    <li>I have worked for this company for almost 20 years.</li>
                    <li>I have been working here for a week.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The present prefect is often used to say wheter an action has happened 
                or not at the present time. The action might be <b>necessary
                or expected </b>by someone, and we want to say if it is complete or not.
                In response to the expectation, we often use <b>just, already and yet</b>
                with present prefect tense.
                <ul>
                    <li>Just: a very short time ago</li>
                    <li>Already: before now or earlier than you/I expected</li>
                    <li>Yet: bofore now / until now</li>
                </ul>
                We use just and already mainly in postive sentences. We use yet in
                negative sentences and in questions. 
                <ul>
                    <li>She’s just finished her second year at university.</li>
                    <li>Steve hasn’t decided which course to apply for yet.</li>
                    <li>Has your tutor approved your research topic yet?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h5>Adjective order</h5>

        <p>
            When more than one adjective comes before noun, the adjectives are 
            normally in a particular order. Adjectives which decribe opinions or 
            attitudes usually come first, before more neutral, facural ones.

        <h5>-ed spelling and pronunciation rules</h5>

        <p>
            In unit 5, we have studied the pronunciation rules related to past prticiple:
        <ul>
            <li>
                /Id/ For verbs that end in /t/ or /d/ sounds: decided, waited;
            </li>
            <li>
                /t/ For verbs that end in /p/, /k/, /sh/ or /ch/ sounds: stopped, finished;
            </li>
            <li>
                /d/ For most other verbs: lived, loved.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are spelling rules of past participle:
            <ul>
                <li>add "-ed" to a verb to change it to the past tense. For example, "talk + ed = talked".</li>
                <li>when the verb ends in a silent "e", add only "d." For example, "arrive + d = arrived".</li>
                <li>when the verb ends in consonant + "y," change the "y" to "i" and add "-ed". For example, 
                    "study + ed = studied".</li>
                <li>when a verb ends in vowel + "y," add "-ed". For example, "play + ed = played".</li>
                <li>when a one-syllable verb ends in vowel + consonant, double the consonant. 
                    For example, "stop + p + ed = stopped".</li>
                <li>when the stress is on the final syllable of a verb that ends in vowel + consonant, 
                    double the consonant. For example, "prefér + r + ed = preferred".</li>
                <li>when the stress is not on the final syllable of a verb that ends in 
                    vowel + consonant, add "-ed" only. For example, "óffer + ed = offered".</li>
            </ul>
            There are verbs which do not follow the regular past tense rules. These are irregular verbs.
            Here are tow summaries you could download:
            <ul>
