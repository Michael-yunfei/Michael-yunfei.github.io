			<h4>Travelling at home</h4>

			<p>
				Because of Covid-19, we could not travel around the world right now. But I miss London a lot and I wish I could visit Paris soon. Thanks to internet, we could still see the beautiy of great cities throught images. It seems that a great river is essential for a city to become a metropolis.

			Presumably, no one would deney that the pandemic caused by Covid-19 would be one of the most dramatic events in this century. Millions of people have died because of it, and billions of people could not live their normal life. I wish the best for our world.
		</p>

		<p>
			For anyone like me who has to postpone vacations abroad, or who want to become more worldly after months stuck at home, learning a foreign english would be a good choice and investment. Anyway, this pandemic did not dampen my enthusiasm for learning English. That's why I am still writing this post.
		</p>

		<h4>Unit 5 Christmas every day: 'Have to' and 'must'</h4>

		<p>
			Last Christmas, I received a gift from my friend. It is a sweater. It fits me very well and transfers me to a fashionable person. I am so happy and that's why I wish we could be <b>at Christmas</b> every day.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the way, did you have a big meal with your family <b>on Christmas Day</b>? Listen to the following podcast and think over whether you 'have to' or 'must' lose weight after Christmas.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you <b>have to do</b> something, it is necessary for you to do it. It’s a law, an obligation or a fact. For instance, <i>you have to get a visa if you want to go to Russia</i>. If you <b>must do</b> something, it is necessary for you to do it, but this is often your opinion or a rule that you have made yourself. For instance, <i>I must remember to buy a birthday gift for my mother</i>. We see <b>must</b> (not have to) in formal written notices or rules that an organization has made itself. Here is an example: <i>All students must be at the examination hall fifteen minutes before the exam.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			We can often use either have to or must in a sentence. But be careful! There a big difference in meaning between don’t have to and mustn’t.If you don’t have to do something, it isn’t necessary to do it, but you can if you want. If you mustn’t do something, it means ‘don’t do it’. It is necessary not to do it. See the differences:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>You don’t have to finish the spreadsheet today. Tomorrow will be fine.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Employees mustn’t send passwords by email.</i>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is possible to ask questions with Must + subject...? but it is much more common to use Do/Does + subject + have to...? And there is no future or past form of must. We use will have to (future)and had to (past).
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Do I have to come to the meeting tomorrow? (Must I come to the meeting tomorrow?)</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>It’s too late now. You’ll have to talk toher tomorrow.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>All the trains were cancelled, so we had to get a taxi.</i>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			In informal British English, we sometimes use have got to instead of have to. They mean the same. For instance, <i>You’ve got to get a visa if you want to go to Russia.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Take note:</b> Have to and must are modal verbs. When we say modal verbs, we usually say them quickly and often without emphasis. So have to sounds like ‘hafta’(haf tə). Must sounds like ‘mus’ (məs). You don’t hear the final /t/ sound in must.
		</p>



		<p>
			<b>Vocabularies: binomials</b>
			<br />
			Yes, in the following podcast, you would learn some <i>short and sweet</i> phrases English speakers love to use in everyday English. <b>Sick and tired</b> is a phrase which means annoyed and bored. Phrases like this with two nouns joined by and are very common and useful in English. They're called binomials.

			<ul>
				<li>
					aches and pains: general body pains that aren’t serious
				</li>
				<li>
					cheap and cheerful: simple, basic and often inexpensive
				</li>
				<li>
					short and sweet: quick and simple
				</li>
				<li>
					black and blue: sore and bruised
				</li>
				<li>
					quick and dirty: short, simple and basic
				</li>
			</ul>

			Christmas is a time for feasting, but how much is too much? <br />
			You are not alone if you worried about gaining weight over the festival season. And overeating at Christmas has a long history in Britian. Now, the average person consumes 6,000 calories on Christmas Day. This is the same as eating 4.8 kg of egg-fried rice, or 42 bananas, or 23 hamburgers. Or you could think of it as eating six 300 g chicken curries, three Indian naan breads and 24 onion bhajis.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since, for most people, Chiristmas Day is usually <b>a time</b> for staying indoors and relaxing, so we probably won't <b>burn off</b> those 6,000 calories when we are watching TV. In fact, an average man has to run for ten hours, and an average woman has to swim for eight hours, to do this. But don't worry. You can be bad and then be good over the other days - it's over in a short space of time, and you can rebalance those extra calories by cutting back elsewhere.
		</p>

		<h4>Unit 6: Great achievers</h4>

		<p>
			The theme of this unit is about 'past simple' tense in English. It is quite easy to understand. But I still learned something new, which is the pronunciation related to the past simple tense:
			<ul>
				<li>
					/Id/ For verbs that end in /t/ or /d/ sounds: decided, waited;
				</li>
				<li>
					/t/ For verbs that end in /p/, /k/, /sh/ or /ch/ sounds: stopped, finished;
				</li>
				<li>
					/d/ For most other verbs: lived, loved.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			Both –ing and –ed adjectives help us to talk about our feelings.The main difference is that –ing adjectives are usually used to talk about the person, place or thing that is making us feel a certain way:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Yawn! This lecture is really boring!
				</li>
			</ul>
			But –ed adjectives are used to talk about how we feel:
			<ul>
				<li>
					I’ve been listening to him for hours – I’m so bored.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Be careful:</b> If you say I am boring – it’s grammatically correct, but it means that you make other people feel bored! <br />
			Hope now you know the differences between those paris of words: relaxing and relaxed; confusing and confused.

			There are many irregular verbs. Here is the list (<a href="../documents/list-of-irregular-verbs.pdf">download it as pdf file</a>). The English language has many irregular verbs, approaching 200 in normal use—and significantly more if prefixed forms are counted.

		<h4>Unit 7: The Titanic (Past simple and past continuous)</h4>

		<p>
			Watch this video, and learn when you should use past continuous tense.
		</p>

		<center>
			<iframe width="80%" height="365" frameborder="0" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p029z376/player"></iframe>
		</center>

		<p>
			We use the past continuous to talk about the past:
			<ul>
				<li>
					for something which happened before and after another action: <i>The children were doing their homework when I got home.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					for something that happened before and after a specific time: <i>It was eight o'clock. I was writing a letter.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					to show that something continued for some time: <i>Everyone was shouting.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					for something that happened again and again: <i>I was practising every day, three times a day.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					with verbs which show change or growth:<i>The children were growing up quickly.</i>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<b>Take note:</b>verbs we don’t use in the past continuous. There are some verbs that we don’t usually use in the continuous form. They are often verbs related to the senses and thinking, for example: hear, see, smell, hate, know, understand, believe, notice, want, need, seem, wish. For instance, <i>Did you know Jess when you were living in Madrid?</i>

			For children, it might be a good idea to learn vocabularies with lexical sets and illustrations. For adults, it is better to read more books. That's it.

			The following news report is funny. Paul Mundy was working in a pub when he decided to become a vicar. He says the two roles are very different, but he actually enjoys both. And there are similarities: both are quite stressful and let you see people at the 'best and worst of time'. He says: "if you've got people coming through the door and the till is rining, you're the happies publican in the world. And if you're standing in the pulpit and you've got lots of bottoms on seats, you're the happiest vicar in the world as well."
