			<h4>It can be slow to learn a foreign language</h4>

			It has been twenty days since I wrote my last post on learning English. I was busy for working and coding. I am happy today that I could summarize what I learned from BBC Learning English website. I did three units:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Unit 2: What to ware
				</li>
				<li>
					Unit 3: Like this, like that
				</li>
				<li>
					Unit 4:
				</li>
			</ul>

			Like I said in my early post, studying English by following organized instructions from BBC would give you an advantage. Before I went throught all readings, listening practices and some other exercies, I thought I knew the meaning of a vocabulary or knew how to use it. But, it turned out that I was wrong once I did some quizzes and checked my answers. Let me give you an example: the usage of advantage and benefits.

			<h5> Advantage or Benefits ?</h5>

			I often misuse advarnage and benefits when I am trying to describe gaining of doing something. However, these two words should be used in different contexts:

			<ul>
				<li>
					advantage means a condition giving a greater chance of success, for instance,
					<ul>
						<li>
							The advantage of booking tickets in advance is that you get better seats.
						</li>
						<li>
							It would be to your advantage (= it would improve the situation for you) to agree to his demands.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					benefit means a helpful or good effect, or something intended to help, for instance,
					<ul>
						<li>
							The discovery of oil brought many benefits to the town.
						</li>
						<li>
							One of the many benefits of foreign travel is learning how to cope with the unexpected.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			So, what's the difference? Anything is helpful would bring benefits, but it does not necessarlily give a greater chance of success.

			From Unit 2 to Unit 4, what would you learn something you did not know before? Let's start it then.



			<h4>Unit 2: What to wear</h4>

			<p>
				First, listen to this podcast and learn some vocabularies.

			</center>

			<p>
				Second, listen to this podcast and learn the grammar.

						</audio>
			</center>

			<p>
				Third, listen to this news report.
			</p>
			<center>
					<audio

				So, what do you normally wear to a <i>social occasion</i> ? I guess it is better not to wear <i>scruffy </i> closthes. On almost every occasion, I wear casually. My friend, Emment, he likes to wear smartly. His sister tends to wear fashionalbe dress to a party.
			</p>

			<p>
					Regardless of our personal choices on style of clothes, fashion business is big. In fact, it <b>is twice</b> (adv.) the size of the UK car industry, according to British Fashion Council. Fashion is more than just dresses and handbags; the industry inclues design, sales and manufacturing. It is <b>the largest</b> (adj.) of the British 'creative industries'.
			</p>

			<p>
				During London fashion week, buyers <b>from across the world</b> spend around 100 million pounds on orders. Many companies are using social media to reach this global market. Burberry puts its <i>catwalk show</i> <b>on the internet</b> so customers can <b>watch online</b> wherever they are.
			</p>

			<h4>Unit 3: Like this, like that</h4>

			<p>
				First, listen to this podcast and learn some vocabularies.

	            <code>audio</code> element.
						</audio>
			</center>

			New vocabularies:
			<ul>
				<li>
					hygienic, unhygienic; tolerable, intolerablel; grace, disgrace
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Second, listen to this podcast and learn the grammar.

				What is preposition? In grammar, preposition is a word that is used before a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun, connecting it to another word. It could be challenging for a beginner to master the rule of using prepositions. You could read the following posts:

					<li>

					</li>
